  <p>Aruba is most famous for its </strong>incredible beaches with almost impossibly white sand and bright turquoise waters. Palm Beach (as the name suggests) is filled with palm trees and backed by glamorous high-rise hotels.
  Aruba is a small open economy with high living standards; its per capita income is one of the highest in the Caribbean region.
  Aruba is an island that lies southwest of <em>the</em> Lesser Antilles in the Caribbean Sea, some 50 miles (80 km) northwest of Curaçao and 18 miles (29 km) north of the Venezuelan peninsula of Paraguaná
